# COVID-19 RISK ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WITH CLUSTERING

Istanbul Medeniyet University 3rd Year END311 Data Mining Final Project.

## About This Project
This project made by İrem Tekin, Elif Alptekin, Duygu Bulut, Sena Aydın and Emine Karaca.
In this project, K-means Clustering Algorithm was used to analyze the risk situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in European countries in the last quarter of 2021. It was created based on the data shared by the OECD and the World Health Organization (WHO).

## About the Data We Used
### Mortality Rate
It is the data showing the death rate per million created by dividing the people who died due to COVID-19 in the countries by the population of the countries. In a study in which countries are clustered in terms of risk, it is important to know the death rate due to COVID-19 in the last three months (2021).

### Testing Rate
It refers to the average daily number of tests performed in countries in the last quarter of 2021. The number of tests is an important attribute for assessing risk in terms of accessibility and control of the country's health system.

### Vaccination Rate
Data showing the ratio of the vaccinated population to the total population in countries in the European continent as of the end of 2021. Vaccines have played an important role in human and animal health in the pandemics that have occurred since 1796. Vaccination rate, which is an important factor in the development of herd immunity, is an important feature for clustering countries in terms of risk.

### Sum of Cases
Data showing the total number of infected individuals in countries in the last quarter of 2021. The number of cases is one of the most important factors in determining the risk of COVID-19 in the country.

### Government Response Index
Nine different qualities were evaluated in the index calculated by the Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), and according to these qualities, the strictness of the decisions made by the countries during the pandemic was measured with a value between 0-100. Attributes used for this index: school closure time, workplace closure time, cancellation of social events, restriction of gatherings, closure of public transport, stay at home, public information campaigns, restriction of intercity transportation and control of international travel. Since these decisions have changed in the last 3 months, the average of the values determined for each day in the last quarter of 2021 is taken in the report. While the excess of this data has a reducing effect on the risk of transmission of the disease, it may have negative social and economic consequences.

### Hospital Bed Capacity
It refers to the number of beds per 1000 people in hospitals in the countries as of the last quarter of 2021. The number of beds, which is considered an important factor in terms of risk management, has come to the fore again with the COVID-19 outbreak.

### Face Mask Wearing Rate
According to the research, one of the factors that reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19 is related to the high rate of wearing masks in the community (WHO, 2020). This factor directly affects the risk situation, it refers to the rates of wearing masks in countries in the last quarter of 2021.

### Health Worker Rate
This factor is important in terms of the adequacy of the health system in the countries during the epidemic.

### Average Daily Cases
It is the data defined as the daily average number of cases detected in the last quarter of 2021 in countries. The high number of cases is a situation that increases the risk.
